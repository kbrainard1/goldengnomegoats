      </summary>
      <p>Yoshi is a gentle giant - weighing in most recently at 230 lbs, he's got some serious length of body!
        Fortunately, he's just as sweet as he is tall - the bottom of the pecking order in the buck pen, and easy to
        handle even when in rut. He worked himself out of a job at his last farm, leaving behind a number of
        high-producing flashy babies. We're excited to see what he does here!</p>

      </summary>
      <p>Pepe is a fantastic easy keeper - keeps his condition well with just hay and pasture, feet
        that rarely need trimming, and a thick glossy coat. He's a bit on the feisty side, but as long as he has a goat
        buddy to play with, he understands that humans are not interested in a good game of Head Butt. He's even made
        some progress at doing some work around the farm in the off season!</p>
