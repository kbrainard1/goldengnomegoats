<p>
Our herd is tested annually, and is Johne’s, CL, and CAE free. The goats are raised primarily on pasture, with supplemental hay, grain, and alfalfa as needed.

<p>
Because goats are social animals, we’ll never sell just one goat unless you already have other goats at home – both you and the goat will be much happier with a buddy!
