  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>Golden Gnome Farms is located in Ulster County, NY, where we raise a small herd of ADGA registered LaMancha goats. Follow the links above to learn more about our herd and available goats</p>
  <p>
    Our herd is tested annually, and is Johne's, CL, and CAE free. The goats are raised primarily on pasture, with
    supplemental hay, grain, and alfalfa as needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    We strive to produce excellent all-around animals - in addition to high milk production,
    we focus on goats that have nice temperaments, good feet, slow metabolisms (ie, don't need a ton of supplemental feed), and parasite
    resistance. Good cashmere production is also considered a plus! Essentially, we want goats that are easy and pleasant to care for.
  <p>
    Because goats are social animals, we'll never sell just one goat unless you already have other goats at home -
    both you and the goat will be much happier with a buddy!
